to use scripts: 

Select and go into the folder named after the script you want to use

click on the script version you want

click raw and copy text or copy directly from the file you see

go into your tampermonkey extension (if you do not have it yet, install it in the browsers extension store) for your browser, and create a new script

paste the code and save

enable developer mode for extensions in the store/settings, on edge you can go to edge://extensions/ and enable developer mode from there

it should work from then on, if not, contact me through my work email
